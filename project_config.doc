# checksum
a) project JSON.stringfy() SHA256 checksum

# tank virtual channels
a) level channel        : 10000 + 100 * tank_ndx
b) pressure channel     : 20000 + 100 * tank_ndx
c) temperature channel  : 30000 + 100 * tank_ndx

# tank physical channels
a) radar physical channel : 10000 + 100 * tank_ndx + 50 + radar_ndx
b) pressure physical channel:  20000 + 100 * tank_ndx + 50 + pressure_ndx
c) temperature physical channel: 30000 + 100 * tank_ndx + 50 + temperature_ndx

# tank alarms
a) sensor fault alarm : same number as physical sensor channel number
b) other alarms : from 1 to increasing


# objects per tank
tank : 
  a) level channel
      -> hi alarm
      -> low alarm
  b) pressure channel
      -> hi alarm
      -> low alarm
  c) temperature channel
      -> hi alarm
      -> low alarm
  d) radar channels
      -> sensor fault alarm
  e) pressure channels
      -> sensor fault alarm
  f) temperature channels
      -> sensor fault alarm

# adding tank
  a) level channel should be created
    by default, low alarm should be created
                hi alarm should be created
  b) pressure channel should be created
    by default, low alarm should be created
                hi alarm should be created
  c) temperature channel should be created
    by default, low alarm should be created
                hi alarm should be created

  1) adding radar sensor
     - physical channel should be created
     - sensor fault alarm should be created

  2) deleting a radar sensor
     - physical channel should be deleted
     - sensor fault alarm should be deleted

  3) adding pressure sensor
     - physical channel should be created
     - sensor fault alarm should be created

  4) deleting pressure sensor
     - physical channel should be deleted
     - sensor fault alarm should be deleted

  5) adding temperature sensor
     - physical channel should be created
     - sensor fault alarm should be created

  6) deleting temperature sensor   
     - physical channel should be deleted
     - sensor fault alarm should be deleted
